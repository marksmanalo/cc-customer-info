# cc-customer-info
A simple, small web application to manage customer information

## Overview
Create a simple, small web application to manage customer information.  

Treat the challenge as if you were creating a commercial, public website.

If you are more back-end focused, we will understand if it isn't the prettiest, but do your professional best to at least have it look presentable.
If you are more front-end focused we will understand if the data storage is something simple, but at least make it store somewhere.
